## Building

Refer the the `makefile` for building.
Works on Mac. Test on Ubuntu

## References:

Where I got the initial client and server program from:  
http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~moorthy/Courses/os98/Pgms/socket.html

Currently unwatched video on C socket programming:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g_nMNJhRVk

This was actually one of the first good references I found:  
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/socket-programming-cc/

The skeleton it provides seems to be less cluttered so I may prefer it over what I used initially.

## Potential future work:

Make compatible with windows:
